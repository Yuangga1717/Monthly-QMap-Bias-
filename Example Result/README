There are several output that we can make based on this code. I am not print all the result, but you can add inside the code for improvement if you want.
Some output result need to be confirm, so I will explain the confirmation of the data
## 4.Evaluasi_metrik.csv
This code conduct several parameter to see the improvement of the data before and after bias corrected.
first of all I print this section because it is strongly recommended if we want to do bias corrected, we need to check the correlation between GCM and our ground first.
so correlation are inside this code, check on this file the value of correlation before you use to confirm.
other parameters is RMSE that usually side by side with correlation.
the other like NSE, PBIAS, RSR, R^2 etc
## 6.Rekap_kesimpulan.txt
this file is a compilation of matrix but I save it as a txt file
## 7.Bulanan_Koreksi.csv
this file for next processing, I want to comparing the result before bias corrected and after bias corrected, so I need to keep original file and use this file for the next process
## 8.Bias_Corrected_Data.csv
this is the final output, raw data after bias corrected, if you use the result of bias corrected data for next process, take the data from this file
## all the plot inside the file and you can copy directly from the plot.
there are 3 kind of plot: plot raw montly data, QQ plot for bias correction, gamma distribution, and CDF Curve plot
