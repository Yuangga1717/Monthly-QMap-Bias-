# Monthly-QMap-Bias-Correction
This for Calculating Rainfall Bias Correction with Quantile Mapping of Satelite data with ground data
I make this for part of my research, compiling from several resource. There are many papers that discuss about quantile mapping for bias correction especially for GCM Data
I try to run this code for Indonesia and it seems it work perfectly. I used Terra Climate as GCM and a lot of ground station
